This is just a simple openCL app that uses the parallel processing power of GPUs and other openCL devices
to generate images of the mandelbrot set.

Its purpose was part of a larger project to compare processing power between several sequential and parallel
platforms but I hope it will help someone, somewhere?

It was designed to work on an nvidia platform, but should work on other platforms with minimal tweaking.

send me a message on github (chriscparr) if you would like any more info.
